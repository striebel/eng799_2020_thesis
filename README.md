A pdf of the thesis can be found here, in this repository's root directory. Chapter 3 describes how to reproduce the thesis's results using the files in this repository, including how to set up an environment, obtain the datasets, and then do model training and evaluation.

Most of this repository's content consists of project dependencies, which are collected here in their needed versions for convenience, and of which I am not the author. `mosesdecoder` is taken from `https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder`. `nematus` is taken from `https://github.com/EdinburghNLP/nematus`. `subword-nmt` is taken from `https://github.com/rsennrich/subword-nmt`. And `wmt16-scripts` is originally from `https://github.com/rsennrich/wmt16-scripts`.
