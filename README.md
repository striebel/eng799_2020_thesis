This repository contains files associated with my master's thesis

> Part-of-Speech Tags as Input Features in German-to-English Neural Machine Translation: A Comparison of Tagsets.

A pdf of the thesis can be found here, in the repository's root directory. Chapter 3 describes how to reproduce the thesis's results, including how to set up an environment, obtain the datasets, and then do model training and evaluation. The scripts of most interest are in the `wmt16-scripts/factored_sample` directory.

Most of this repository's content consists of project dependencies, which are collected here in their needed versions for convenience, and of which I am not the author. `mosesdecoder` is taken from `https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder`. `nematus` is taken from `https://github.com/EdinburghNLP/nematus`. `subword-nmt` is taken from `https://github.com/rsennrich/subword-nmt`. And `wmt16-scripts` is originally from `https://github.com/rsennrich/wmt16-scripts`.
