A pdf of the thesis can be found here, in the repository's root directory. The abstract on p. iii summarizes the project and its findings. Chapter 3 describes how to reproduce those findings, including how to set up an environment, obtain the datasets, and then do model training and evaluation. The scripts of most interest are in the `wmt16-scripts/factored_sample` directory.

Most of this repository's content consists of project dependencies, which are collected here in their needed versions for convenience. `mosesdecoder` is taken from `https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder`. `nematus` is taken from `https://github.com/EdinburghNLP/nematus`. `subword-nmt` is taken from `https://github.com/rsennrich/subword-nmt`. And `wmt16-scripts` is originally from `https://github.com/rsennrich/wmt16-scripts`.
