&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part-of-Speech Tags as Input Features in German-to-English Neural Machine Translation: A Comparison of Tagsets.

The scripts to reproduce my results are in

Most of this repository's content consists of project dependencies, which are collected here in their needed versions because they are not available through a package manager, and of which I am not the author. `mosesdecoder` is taken from `https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder`. `nematus` is taken from `https://github.com/EdinburghNLP/nematus`. `subword-nmt` is taken from `https://github.com/rsennrich/subword-nmt`. And `wmt16-scripts` is originally from `https://github.com/rsennrich/wmt16-scripts`.
